                    <h2>Solar Power</h2>
                    <p>Solar energy is the conversion of sunlight directly into electricity using <b>photovoltaic (PV) panels</b>. The Philippines' high solar irradiance makes it a perfect candidate for both large-scale solar farms and decentralized rooftop installations, promoting energy independence. <b>The national government supports solar expansion through the Net Metering Program, encouraging homeowners and businesses to generate their own power and feed excess electricity back to the grid.</b></p>
                    <p>This source is crucial for powering remote islands and communities not connected to the main grid, offering a quick and scalable solution to energy poverty. <b>Its flexibility allows for deployment in diverse environments, from large floating solar arrays on reservoirs to small-scale urban rooftop installations.</b></p>

            <div class="fact-callout">
                <h3>Quick Fact: Solar</h3>
                <p>A typical residential rooftop solar system in the Philippines can offset nearly 4 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year, equivalent to planting 100 trees. 🌳</p>

                <div class="content-text">
                    <h2>Wind Power</h2>
                    <p>Wind turbines capture <b>kinetic energy</b> from the wind and convert it into electricity. Ideal for coastal areas, the Philippines is utilizing its strong wind corridors, particularly in Northern Luzon, to build utility-scale wind farms. <b>Notable locations like Bangui and Burgos in Ilocos are already major contributors to the Luzon grid, demonstrating the viability of this resource.</b></p>
                    <p>This technology offers substantial capacity and contributes significantly to the national grid during peak periods. <b>The country is also heavily exploring its vast offshore wind potential, which is expected to dwarf current onshore capacity and be a key driver in meeting 2040 climate goals.</b> The continuous improvements in turbine technology are making wind energy increasingly cost-competitive.</p>

                <h3>Quick Fact: Wind</h3>
                <p>The iconic Bangui Wind Farm in Ilocos Norte, with its 20 wind turbines, was one of the first major wind projects in Southeast Asia, pioneering the country's utility-scale clean energy efforts. 🌬️</p>

                <div class="content-text">
                    <h2>Hydropower</h2>
                    <p>Hydropower generates electricity from moving water, primarily through dams or run-of-river systems. It is a mature, <b>reliable base-load</b> source that provides stable power and often aids in water management, irrigation, and flood control. <b>Major hydroelectric dams like Pantabangan and Magat are vital national assets, regulating water supply and providing firm power to the grid.</b></p>
                    <p>While large dams have environmental considerations, the focus has shifted toward developing <b>small-scale and mini-hydro facilities</b> which utilize the natural flow of rivers with minimal structural impact. This stability is essential for balancing the intermittency of newer sources like solar and wind, ensuring continuous power supply for industrial and residential use. <b>The long operational life of hydropower facilities makes them an attractive long-term investment for energy security.</b></p>

            <div class="fact-callout">
                <h3>Quick Fact: Hydropower</h3>
                <p>Hydropower is a base-load source, meaning it can produce power consistently and on demand, unlike solar and wind, which are intermittent. This stability is vital for grid reliability. 💧</p>

            <div class="content-block" id="geothermal">
                <div class="content-text">
                    <h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
                    <p>The Philippines is one of the <b>world's top producers</b> of geothermal energy, thanks to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. This resource harnesses the Earth's internal heat to create steam, which powers turbines to generate <b>consistent, 24/7, non-intermittent power</b>. <b>The country currently operates seven major geothermal fields, concentrated in areas like Leyte, Bicol, and Negros, contributing a substantial portion of the nation's total power supply.</b></p>
                    <p>Geothermal power is a crucial factor in the country's energy security and independence strategy because it is a reliable, domestically-sourced power that is not subject to global fuel price fluctuations. <b>As a clean and indigenous resource, it provides a stable foundation upon which to build a diversified renewable energy portfolio, offsetting the need for fossil fuels.</b></p>

                <h3>Quick Fact: Geothermal</h3>
                <p>The Philippines is second globally in geothermal power generation, with plants like the Tiwi Geothermal Power Plant in Albay running on natural heat from deep within the earth. 🔥</p>

            <div class="content-block" id="biomass">
                <div class="content-text">
                    <h2>Biomass Energy</h2>
                    <p>Biomass energy is produced from organic matter, such as agricultural waste (rice husks, sugarcane residue), animal manure, or dedicated energy crops. It is converted into heat or electricity through combustion or gasification, making it a valuable way to <b>manage waste</b>. <b>This process not only generates power but also helps solve significant agricultural waste disposal challenges, particularly in provinces that rely heavily on crops like sugarcane (bagasse) and rice (husks).</b></p>
                    <p>In the Philippines, biomass provides a dual benefit: generating power and providing a sustainable disposal method for agricultural byproducts. <b>Biomass is considered carbon-neutral because the carbon dioxide released during combustion is equal to the amount absorbed by the plants during their growth cycle, making it a sustainable cycle for rural development.</b></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Quick Fact: Biomass</h3>
                <p>The vast quantities of rice husks and sugarcane bagasse left over from Philippine agriculture are increasingly being used to fuel biomass power plants, turning waste into clean electricity. 🍚</p>
